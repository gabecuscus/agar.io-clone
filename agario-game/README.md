# Multiplayer Blob Game

This is a multiplayer blob game inspired by **Agar.io** where players control blobs that move around the game world. The objective is to grow your blob by consuming smaller blobs and other players while avoiding being consumed by larger blobs. The game includes AI players, player splitting, repulsion between blobs, and merging mechanics. The leaderboard shows the top players.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Blobs move towards the cursor, with smaller blobs moving faster than larger ones.
- **Splitting**: Players can split their blob into smaller parts.
- **Merging**: Blobs automatically merge after a set amount of time.
- **Repulsion**: Blobs repel each other to prevent overlap.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays the top 10 players with the current player highlighted.
- **AI Players**: Computer-controlled players also compete in the game.

## To-Do List

### General Improvements

- [ ] **Improve Movement**: Adjust mouse movement to ensure smaller blobs move faster and larger blobs move slower.
- [ ] **Refine Repulsion Logic**: Improve the repulsion behavior between blobs to ensure they don't overlap but can still stay close.
- [ ] **Add Split/Merge Cooldown**: Implement a cooldown for merging blobs every 5 seconds, regardless of the number of blobs.

### Player Features

- [ ] **Enhance Player Controls**: Ensure smooth player movement and blob control.
- [ ] **Refine Player Blob Attraction**: Speed up blob attraction based on mass (smaller blobs attract faster).
- [ ] **Collision Logic**: Fine-tune the collision mechanics between blobs and walls.
  
### AI Improvements

- [ ] **Improve AI Movement**: Implement smarter AI behavior, making AI players chase smaller blobs and avoid larger ones.
- [ ] **AI Splitting**: Enable AI players to split their blobs when necessary.

### Leaderboard

- [x] **Highlight Player in Leaderboard**: Always highlight the current player in red in the leaderboard, regardless of their position.
- [ ] **Leaderboard Real-Time Update**: Ensure the leaderboard updates dynamically without lag.
  
### Performance & Optimization

- [ ] **Optimize Blob Physics**: Improve performance by optimizing collision detection and movement calculations.
- [ ] **Optimize Rendering**: Implement efficient rendering methods to handle larger numbers of blobs and players.

### UI and UX

- [ ] **Add Score UI**: Display the player's current score and mass on the screen.
- [ ] **Add Settings Menu**: Implement a settings menu for volume control, graphics, and gameplay options.
- [ ] **Mobile Compatibility**: Add support for mobile controls and ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.
