# Agario Clone

This is a multiplayer blob game inspired by **Agar.io** where players control blobs that move around the game world. The objective is to grow your blob by consuming smaller blobs and other players while avoiding being consumed by larger blobs. The game includes AI players, player splitting, repulsion between blobs, and merging mechanics. The leaderboard shows the top players.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Blobs move towards the cursor, with smaller blobs moving faster than larger ones.
- **Splitting**: Players can split their blob into smaller parts.
- **Merging**: Blobs automatically merge after a set amount of time.
- **Repulsion**: Blobs repel each other to prevent overlap.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays the top 10 players with the current player highlighted.
- **AI Players**: Computer-controlled players also compete in the game.
